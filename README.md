# Video Stream Buffering Data Aggregator
This Python script provides a foundational data aggregation pipeline for analyzing video stream performance. It processes raw event data, such as buffering events, and calculates key metrics to give insight into user experience.

The script is a great starting point for a scheduled job or an analytics tool. It's designed to be easily adapted for integration with a live database.

Dependencies
This script has no external dependencies beyond the standard Python library. It uses the datetime and json modules, which are included in Python by default.

Project Structure
aggregate_data.py: The main script containing the data aggregation logic, metric calculation, and output formatting. It includes a simulated database fetch function for demonstration.

How It Works
The core of the script follows a clear data processing workflow:

Data Fetching: The fetch_raw_events_from_db() function simulates a database query. It retrieves a list of raw events, each containing a user_id, session_id, event_type (buffer_start or buffer_end), and a timestamp.

Event Aggregation: The aggregate_buffering_data() function processes these events. It sorts them chronologically and pairs buffer_start and buffer_end events for each session to accurately calculate the total buffer duration.

Metrics Generation: The generate_summary_metrics() function computes high-level statistics like total buffer time and average buffer time per session from the aggregated data.

Output: The script prints a clean, human-readable summary of both session-specific and overall performance metrics.

Key Metrics
The script outputs the following metrics:

Total Buffer Time per Session: The total duration (in seconds) that each session spent buffering.

Number of Buffering Events per Session: The count of discrete buffering events within each session.

Total Sessions with Buffering: The total number of unique sessions that experienced at least one buffering event.

Total Buffer Time (All Sessions): The sum of all buffering durations across all sessions.

Total Buffering Events (All Sessions): The total count of all buffering events.

Average Buffer Time per Session: The average time a session spent buffering.

Average Buffer Time per Event: The average duration of a single buffering event.

How to Run
To run the script, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command:

python aggregate_data.py

Future Enhancements
Database Integration: Replace the fetch_raw_events_from_db() simulation with a real database connection (e.g., using a library like psycopg2 for PostgreSQL or pymongo for MongoDB).

Time Period Filtering: Add functionality to filter events by a specific date or time range to analyze performance over different periods.

Error Logging: Implement a more robust logging system to capture and report parsing errors or other data inconsistencies.

New Event Types: Extend the aggregation logic to handle other event types, such as video quality changes, playback starts, or playback completions, for a more holistic view of user behavior.
